## termuxessentialsbyvk

A small toolkit for Termux that lets you:  

- **`copy <filename>`**  

  Copy a file’s contents to your system clipboard.

- **`erase <filename>`**  

  Completely wipe out a file’s contents, leaving an empty file behind.

- **`delete <path> or <filename>`**  

  Remove a single file or directory (recursively) with a single command.

- **`overwrite <filename>`**  

  Replace a file’s entire contents with whatever is currently in your clipboard.

- **`create <path> or <filename>`**  

  Create a single file **or** directory in one go.  

- **`open`** (alias: **`o`**)  

  The “omni-tool” launcher — drill into any file or folder and pick from view, edit, share, move, rename, delete, etc., all without leaving your prompt.

- **`xtract`**  

  Scrape **all** HTML tables and hyperlinks from one or more paginated web pages in a single invocation. Perfect for harvesting catalogues, reports, or any tabular data spread across multiple pages.

## Installation

```bash

```

## Upgrade

If the commands are not working as intended, there might be a possible update in this code. As this is a tiny personal project, no upgrades are directly provided, and all changes are made to the main version itself. So force install the code for better performance. 

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/vkdatta/termuxessentialsbyvk.git
```

> __**Tips for `xtract`**__  

>  Enter: `example.com/article/p.html` to extract tables/links from that URL only  

>  Enter: `example.com/article/100` [if the same URL has multiple pages] to extract tables/links from 100th page only

>  Enter: `example.com/article/{100}` [if the same URL has multiple pages] to extract tables/links from 1st page to 100th page [Observe flower brackets]
