## vkessentialsbundle

A small handy bundle for Termux that lets you ```copy```, ```erase```, and ```overwrite``` contents inside a file via these simple commands. 

Plus ```xtract``` web scraper tool that extracts link/tables from multiple web pages!

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vkdatta/termuxessentialsbyvk.git
```

## Upgrade

If the ```copy```, ```erase```, ```overwrite```, ```xtract``` commands are not working as intended, there might be a possible update in this code. 

As this is a tiny personal project, no upgrades are directly provided, and all changes are made to the main version itself. So force install the code for better performance. 

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/vkdatta/termuxessentialsbyvk.git
```
